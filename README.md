A small application using React and Node to interact with Twitter API
as part of Elmo HR onboarding test.

You can see my thoughts on the process inside [Challenges](./challenges.md)

To run the application 

for the client 

```sh
 cd client/ npm i && npm run start

```


for the server 

```sh
 cd server/  npm i && npm run start:dev
```


Two starter templates were used to reduce config time, more details can be found inside the client and server folders.
