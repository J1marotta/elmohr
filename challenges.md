Here is my footnotes about what challenges, I experiences while doing this application, and also just a log of my thoughts along the way.  

Given the time limit, I decided to use a CRA template with typescript and redux already included, and I found [unicorn](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/cra-template-unicorn) 

Which has TS, redux-toolkit, emotion for styling, prettier and testing library already included.

As for the node server I'm using [simple-typescript-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/simple-typescript-starter)

This helped me get over the inital set up hurdles and move to code over config.

My First challenge was understanding Twitter API, as I've not interacted with and API that had `OAuth 1.0` authentication. Twitter docs bounced me around a bit before I understood what was required.
